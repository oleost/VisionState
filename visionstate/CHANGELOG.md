# Changelog

## 0.2.1

Security and privacy hardening.

- Camera passwords in RTSP/HTTP URLs (including `?user=&password=`) are hidden in logs and error messages.
- Exported sensor bundles no longer contain camera credentials; after import you are asked to re-enter the URL.
- Imported bundles are validated exactly like sensors created in the UI.
- Size limits for uploads and ZIP archives (see `UPLOAD_LIMITS` in `settings.py`).
- Stricter static file serving.

## 0.2.0

- **Triggers** (sensor → Settings → *When to check*):
  - Check when any chosen Home Assistant entity changes state (motion sensor, door contact, garage opener, …).
  - Optional change detection: compares the region every few seconds and only runs the AI when it changed;
    shows the measured change so the sensitivity is easy to tune.
  - After a trigger the sensor keeps checking at a faster pace for a while (burst) to catch the final state.
  - The regular interval stays as a safety net and can now be set much longer.
- Label tab shows what triggered the last check; Settings shows the trigger event connection.
- `last_trigger` attribute on the state entity.
- Existing databases are upgraded automatically.

## 0.1.0

First test release.

- Sensors with 2–9 states, a region of interest and any Home Assistant camera, HTTP snapshot URL or RTSP stream.
- Label live frames with one click or keys 1–9; the model retrains in about a second.
- Bulk upload of images, ZIP archives and video (frame extraction with duplicate skipping) with model suggestions.
- Review queue for low-confidence, flip-flopping and spot-check frames.
- Quality page: cross-validated accuracy, confusion matrix, day/night coverage and tips.
- Home Assistant entities via MQTT discovery: state, confidence, last frame, classify button, enable switch.
- Export and import of sensors as ZIP bundles.
- Bundled DINOv2-small (8-bit) model; optional full-precision model.
